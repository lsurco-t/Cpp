# C++ Modules

A progression through fundamental to advanced C++ concepts across 10 modules (cpp00-cpp09).

## Overview

- **cpp00** - C++ basics, classes, I/O
- **cpp01** - Memory management, pointers, references
- **cpp02** - Operator overloading, fixed-point numbers
- **cpp03** - Inheritance hierarchies
- **cpp04** - Polymorphism and abstract classes
- **cpp05** - Exception handling
- **cpp06** - Type casting
- **cpp07** - Templates
- **cpp08** - STL containers
- **cpp09** - Advanced STL usage

## Building

Each exercise has a Makefile:
```bash
make        # Compile
make clean  # Remove objects
make fclean # Full clean
```

Compiled with: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -std=c++11`
